# TravelManagementSystem
I have written a code for the travel management system.
The code you provided appears to be a C++ program. It's a console-based application that seems to be a simple travel agency management system. It includes classes for managing customers, cab services, hotel bookings, charges, and bills. The program interacts with users through the console, allowing them to input details, book cabs and hotels, and generate receipts.

**Here's a brief overview of the main classes:**

**manage_menu:** Handles initialization, gets the admin name, and calls the menu function.\n
**customers:** Manages customer details, allowing users to input and display customer information.\n
**cabs:** Manages cab details, including types of cabs, distances, and costs.\n
**booking:** Handles hotel bookings and package choices.\n
**charges:** Inherits from booking, cabs, and customers, and manages the printing and displaying of bills and receipts.\n
**menu:** Displays the main menu and handles user choices, invoking relevant functionalities.\n
